This directory should serve as a good model of how computer homework assignments can be structured. It contains a Python solution to the first homework problem of the semester, along with a test of the included implementation of Lagrange interpolation.

To run the test, type at the command line

```
make test
```

followed by ``Enter``. To run the code for the actual homework problem, simply type

```
make
```

followed by ``Enter``. You can see what these commands do by looking in the file called ``Makefile``.
